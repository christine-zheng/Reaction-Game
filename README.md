# Reaction Game

This repo is home for the codebase that powers Reaction Game, a web application game for users to test their reaction times.

- This app includes: user authentication, reaction game, usersâ€™ game records, and leaderboard.
- Game Info: Each time the box changes color, user should try to "react"/click as fast as they can. There are about 7-10 color changes in a game, so the app will track the user's reaction time to each color change. The results will show the user's best and average time from the game.
- Users can easily view and track the stats from their past games (data visualization implemented using Chartjs).

1. Install NPM packages `npm install`
2. Create database `createdb reaction-game` and seed file `npm run seed`
